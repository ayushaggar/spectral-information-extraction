Target Detection with Hyperspectral Imagery

1) See the development, analysis, and application of sub-pixel target detection algorithms in hyperspectral imaging data. 

2) Library generation, data acquisition, and detection using statistical, physical, or heuristic approach. 

3) Results were shown from hyperspectral imaging data from Hyperion sensors of Delhi (Man- Made) and Himalayan region (Natural) and Matlab GUI to extract the spectral information of the materials for comparison.
